README

This project includes a simple app called polls, which allows users to vote
on a series of questions.

The frontend of the app is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage
features sections that pin during scrolling.

The backend of the app uses Django and SQLite. These parts were created with
the help of the Django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/).
